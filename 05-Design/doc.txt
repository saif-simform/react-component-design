##Shadow
-> Shadow is used to create 3d interfaces.
-> It can be used on boxes and text
-> Use small shadows for smaller elements that should stand out (to draw attention)
Ex: Heighliting text area, button etc

-> Use medium-sized shadows for larger areas that should stand out a bit more
Ex: Card details(swipper)

-> Use large shadowsfor elements that should really float above the interface
Ex: Navigation bar, dropdown
