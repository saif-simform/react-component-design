## Responsive Design Ingredients

1. Fuid Layouts
-> To allow webpage to adapt to the cureent viewport width
-> Use %( or vh/vw) unit instead of px for elements that shout adapt to viewport
-> Use max-width instead of width



2. Responsive Units
-> Use rem unit instead of px for most lengths
->To make it easy to scale the entire layout down (or up) automatically

3. Flexible Images
-> By default, images don't scale automatically as we change the viewport, so we need to fix that
-> Always use % for image dimensions, together with the max-width property


4. Media Queries
-> Bring responsive sites to life@
-> To change CSS styles on certain viewport widths
