## Layout
-> Layout is the way text,images and other content is placed and arranged on a webpage.
-> Building layout : Arranging page elements into a visual structure, instead of simply having them placed one after another.

## Types of layout
1. Page Layout 
2. Component Layout

## 3 ways of building layout
1.Float layouts :
-> The old way of building layouts of all sizes, using the float CSS property.
-> The floated element is removed from the normal flow: "out of flow".
-> Text and inline elements will wrap around the floated element.
-> The container will not adjust its height to the element.
-> defaul behaviour of a model is "content box" to convert it into border box : box-sizing:border-box
-> To clear floating impact : clear:left,clear:right, clear:both

Ex:CSS : float:left, float:right



2. Flexbox: 
-> Modern way of laying out elements in a "1-dimensional row" without using floats.
-> Perfect for "component layouts".
-> Flexbox is a set of related CSS properties for building "1-dimensional layouts".
-> The main idea behind Flexbox is that empty space inside a container element can be automatically divided by its child elements.
-> Flexbox makes it easy to automatically align items to one another inside a parent container, both horizontally and vertically.
->Flexbox solves common problems such as vertical centering and creating equal height columns.

-> To center element vertically : align-item :center  (Align item on cross-axis)
-> To center element horizontally : justify-content: center, defaul is "flex-start"  (align item on main-axis)

3. CSS Grid:
-> For laying out element in a fully fledged "2-dimensional grid".
-> Perfect for "page layouts" and "complex components"
